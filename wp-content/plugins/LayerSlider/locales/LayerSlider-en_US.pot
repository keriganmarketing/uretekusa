"LayerSlider 6 is just the beginning of our awesome new ideas. One of the "
"main goals was to completely rebuild the plugin architecture and modernize "
"its core. This allows us to implement new features way more faster and "
"improve upon existing functionality with an easily maintainable code base. "
"Beyond the predictable feature updates like the complete overhaul of skins, "
"dynamic contents, etc (which will arrive very soon); we already have an "
"experimental offline slider editor and preliminary support for LayerSlider "
"extensions. This later one will soon be available for anyone to extend the "
"plugins capabilities."
